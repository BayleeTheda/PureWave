# PureWave
**PureWave** is a **web application** project to enhance audio recordings specifically for **producers and editors** to get a **"dry and clean"** audio rather than **"boosted or bright"** audio that most audio enhancer provides. The features for this app is still very open for expansion. But to start, for every project that is created, **the default feature will be to denoise an audio recording** (mainly designed for speech).
